# Web Dev Project Starter

This is a simple Web Developer Starter pack with basic configuration. It uses Parcel JS bundler for local server development and bundling to production code.

Features:
* ESLint and Prettier integration.
* Live local server with hot reload.
* ES6 and higher support with Babel.
* Basic file tree.
* SASS support (You can use regular css if you wish).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/adamwojnicki/web-dev-starter.git
```
2. From inside of the folder install dependencies:

### Scripts
3. To run local development server run:
```
